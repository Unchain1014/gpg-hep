QUICK GUIDE:
  1. Start the launcher with gpg-hep.sh
   - Double click the gpg-hep.sh file in the cloned directory and select "Run in Terminal"
   - This is the recommended method of launching scripts (to ensure working directories are correct)
   - Alternatively you can enter the following command to start the launcher:
    cd ~/gpg-hep ; ./gpg-hep.sh

  2. Install prerequisite packages
   - GPG-HEP has four package dependencies; GPG, EXIFTOOL, PULSEAUDIO, LOLCAT
   - These can be installed manually, or you can type "p" in the launcher to run the automated installer
     > PULSEAUDIO and LOLCAT are not required for full functionality as they are only providing sound and color
     > A future "light" version of GPG-HEP will be available without these dependencies

  3. Create a shared key file
   - A key file contains 250 random characters used as the passphrase to encrypt/decrypt files
   - Start creating a key file by typing "k" in the launcher or running the following command:
     cd ~/gpg-hep/scripts ; ./kgen.sh
   - This key file should be encrypted with a strong shared passphrase
   - You must coordinate this shared passphrase with the recipient

  4. Encrypt text
   - Before encrypting text you must have a .gpg key file in the "files" directory
   - Begin text encryption by typing "te" in the launcher
   - Because text editing is limited in most terminals, you may wish to use a text editor to compose your message and then paste it into the terminal with "Control + Shift + V" 

  5. Decrypt text

  6. Encrypt a media file

  7. Decrypt a media file

  8. Strip media file metadata

SECURITY TIPS
  - When coordinating your shared key file passhprase with the recipient, physical communication is always best
  - The key file should always be transferred separately from files
  - You should never store the key with associated files unless processing them
